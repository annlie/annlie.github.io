			<h3>yeuu</h3>
			<p>For my midterm, I would like to make a mockup of a site for my brand <i>yeuu</i>. My brand involves the logo I've created to represent myself; for my mockup site, I would like it to begin with a homepage featuring just my logo that would then link to either a shop page or an about page.</p>
			<p>The shop page will have three page options: a sticker, tote bag, and other page for the three item types my store will sell. The about page will explain the brand and what it represents</p>
