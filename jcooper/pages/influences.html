				<p>
					With parents who worked as freshwater ecologists, Cooper was often surrounded with nature and animal forms from all over the world. This combined with her interest in folklore and the "<i>exploration of human experience, psychology, and philosophy through a surreal lens,</i>" is what brings her art to life. Her artwork often emits a magical aura.
